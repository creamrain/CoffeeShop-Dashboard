# Coffee Sales Data Analysis

This is my first Excel project after completing the Excel Skills for Data Analytics and Visualization Specialization at Macquarie University.

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to track the coffee sales from 2019 to 2022, providing insights into the company's performance and expanding the business.
Through this project, stakeholders can discover their most popular coffees, coffee roast types, country sales, and top 5 customers. 

### Data Source

Coffee Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "coffeeOrdersData.xlsx" file. It contains detailed information regarding each coffee order, customer personal information, and coffee product.

### Tools Used

Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning and Preparation)
- Pivot Tables
- Pivot Charts

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

1. Create New Columns such as customer names, email, country, coffee type, roast type, size, unit price, and sales using excel functions such as XLOOKUP, VLOOKUP, INDEX, and MATCH.

2.  Reformat Coffee Type and Roast Type using IF statements

### Key Takeaways

- In general, the total sales have increased from 2019 to 2021, with a slight dip in 2020. Although the sales in 2022 show that they are significantly lower than in all the previous years, we cannot consider 2022 in our analysis as the data I have for 2022 is incomplete, stopping at the 3rd quarter. 

- From 2019 to 2020, Excelsa was the most popular coffee, but its sales have dipped in 2021. In 2021, Arabica was the most popular coffee, and its 2021 sales were the highest as compared to other coffees in the different years. 

- Light roast coffee is the favourite type of coffee roast, making $17354, while dark roast coffee is the least favoured type of roast, making $13180.

- Throughout the years, the Sales from the United States have always been the highest amount among the 3 countries, leading the remaining countries by a huge amount. This is followed by Ireland and United Kingdom.

- Throughout the years, the highest spender was Allis Wilmore ($317), followed by Brenn Dundredge($307), Terri Farra($289), Nealson Cuttler($282), and Don Flintiff($278)
